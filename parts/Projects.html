                            sent over to a PC where a python script runs to recognize the gesture made. Gesture

                            with supervised learning on the inputs of the glove and can be used to interpret sign

                            the program for which it takes in the input of the light sensors and then makes a decision
                            to move. The

                            using functional programming.
                            Using Apache Spark one of Scala's popular framework I was able to work with ML and big data.
                            Topics such as supervised/unsupervised learning, ANN, DNN, linear regression, and K-Nearest
                            Neighbors was explored.</p>
