                <p class="card-text">My role at Loblaw involved using my skills to help the Network Facilities
                    department,
                    although I was a general intern at the Network Facilities department I spent most of
                    my time with the Automation Team and Forensics Team. I have done automation
                    working with python scripts, Microsoft Power Automate and Power BI, and Ansible.
                    Some of the tasks include writing scripts to create a schedule to send out co-workers,
                    creating server health checks, and automating redundant tasks. The Forensics team
                    was dealt with network issues that would arise in the Head Office or any of the stores
                    located throughout Canada. My time with the Forensics Team helped me with
                    problem-solving skills, I also helped display data using tools like ServiceNow and
                    Power BI.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Working as a PC Express clerk, my task was to complete grocery orders on time that
                    were sent by customers. Coordinating in small teams allowed my colleagues and I to
                    provide excellent service, finish the order, and other tasks on time. Taking initiative
                    was crucial in this working environment since a lot of the time we were not under
                    supervision of a manager, therefore whenever a problem occured my team and I
                    would resolve it in the best way possible.</p>

                <p class="card-text">In a small span of time, I was trained to provide service as a Concession Clerk, my
                    responsibilities included interacting with customers providing food, being able to open
                    and close the concession stand, and being able to work with cash. Although the time
                    spent at Cineplex was short, I was able to gather experience working in a stressful and
                    time-sensitive environment with my colleagues.</p>
