        Network Analyst
        Loblaw Companies Limited • Mississauga, Ontario
        My role at Loblaw involved using my skills to help the Network Facilities department,
        although I was a general intern at the Network Facilities department I spent most of
        my time with the Automation Team and Forensics Team. I have done automation
        working with python scripts, Microsoft Power Automate and Power BI, and Ansible.
        Some of the tasks include writing scripts to create a schedule to send out co-workers,
        creating server health checks, and automating redundant tasks. The Forensics team
        was dealt with network issues that would arise in the Head Office or any of the stores
        located throughout Canada. My time with the Forensics Team helped me with
        problem-solving skills, I also helped display data using tools like ServiceNow and
        Power BI.</p>

        04/2020 - 08/2021
        Cashier/PC Express Clerk
        Loblaws Companies Limited • Toronto, Ontario
        Working as a PC Express clerk, my task was to complete grocery orders on time that
        were sent by customers. Coordinating in small teams allowed my colleagues and I to
        provide excellent service, finish the order, and other tasks on time. Taking initiative
        was crucial in this working environment since a lot of the time we were not under
        supervision of a manager, therefore whenever a problem occured my team and I
        would resolve it in the best way possible.

        Concessions Cashier
        Cineplex Entertainments • Toronto, Ontario
        In a small span of time, I was trained to provide service as a Concession Clerk, my
        06/2017 - 08/2017
        responsibilities included interacting with customers providing food, being able to open
        and close the concession stand, and being able to work with cash. Although the time
        spent at Cineplex was short, I was able to gather experience working in a stressful and
        time-sensitive environment with my colleagues.
